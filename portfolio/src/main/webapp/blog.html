                    <p> Hi! My name is Fetita. I like attention at any hour of the day.
                    I enjoy sleeping and eating, I am really revolted I cannot do both at the same time,
                    maybe just in my dreams. I have a lot of toys for cats, but none of them compare
                    with the feeling I have when I scratch my family; They make a funny noise, or they
                    say something funny.
                    <br>
                    I was nice to present myself in front of you guys! Scratch you next time!
                    Love and meow to all of you!

                <h2>Flying kites and feeding ducks:</h2>
                    <div class="postbody">
                        <p> Sometimes the school or job can take a lot out of us, and not all the time
                        we have time to go on a short trip. When I find myself in this situation
                        I like to take my best friend, a kite and bread and go to the nearest park. 
                        The image of the kite going through ups and downs, sometimes hitting the ground
                        and sometimes flying so high it's hard to see it, gives me peace. Ducks can
                        be funny mates to find yourself hanging out with.
                        <br>
                        Yeah, so when you find yourself lost and sad, just go out with a kite.
