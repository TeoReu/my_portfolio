                <p> Hi! My name is Fetita. I like attention at any hour of the day.
                I enjoy sleeping and eating, I am really revolted I cannot do both at the same time,
                maybe just in my dreams. I have a lot of toys for cats, but none of them compare
                with the feeling I have when I scrach my family; They make a funny noice, or they
                say something funny.
                <br>
                I was nice to present myself in front of you guys! Scrach you next time!
                Love and meow to all of you!
                </p>

            <h2>Flying kites and feeding ducks:</h2>
            <div class="postbody">
                <p> Sometimes the school or job can take a lot out of us, and not all the time
                we have time to go in a short trip. When I find myself in this situation
                I like to take my best friend, a kite and bread and go to the nearest park. 
                The image of kite going trough ups and downs, sometimes hitting the ground
                and sometimes flying so high its hard to see it, gives me peace. Ducks can
                be funny mates to find youself hanging out with.
                <br>
                Yeah, so when you find yourself lost and sad, just go out with a kite.
