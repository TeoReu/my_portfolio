            <p id="selfPresentation"> My name is Teo and I just finished my first year at the University of Manchester Computer Science and Maths. If one year ago I was more passionate about Mathematics (Linear Algebra, Combinatorics, Geometry, Algorithms ...), this year I learned about programming (got more confidence in coding), so a whole new world opened to me (from games done in Unity and Python, to doing my first neural network). My hobbies are playing piano (right now I am living my dream and playing Mozart sonatas), painting (on canvas and on graphical tablet), reading (anything from Bulgakov to Camus), flying kites, and climbing (I used to climb with my parents since 4, so I have it in my blood). My dream is to learn about what this world has to offer, and see it all.
